# Random things/thoughts on openVINO

# From IoT Developer Show Season 2
# Title: Introducing OpenVINO and Computer Vision

1. OpenVINO: Open Visual Inference and Neural network Optimization Toolkit
2. OpenVINO gives developers the power to create cutting edge AI powered
computer vision applications.
3. DEMO: used deep neural network models to detect position and orientation of
face, gender, age and mood.
4. Traditional Computer Vision VS. Deep Learning:
   1. Traditional
      - Analyze using programmatic methods
      - Example: Haar cascade classifiers - taking difference of pixel values in
      many area and linking it to known features. (two eyes + oval = face)
   2. Deep Learning
      - Instead of telling computers to what to look for (for example, eyes),
      show the computer 10,000 images of a face from various angles, and it
      learns what it looks like by adjusting the structure of a complex,
      interconnected network of nodes.
      - MIT Technology Review(The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI): "We can build
      this models, but we don't know how they work." - Joel
5. Deep Learning
   - Components: 1. Training Phase; computer learns, 2. Inference Phase; trained model is used to
   infer the identity of unknown objects.
6. Features and Benefits
   - Combination of tools for computer vision and AI.
   - Uses OpenCV 3.3 optimized for Intel architecture: For pre-processing an
   image for analysis purpose.
   - Then, used to run analysis on it using programmatic methods or deep neural
   networks.
7. Inference Engine
   - Has a custom inference engine
   - Used to run the inference phase of deep learning.
   - Flexibility and Performance.
   - Utilized: CPU, Integrated GPU, VPU - Movidius Compute Stick, FPGA - Altera
   Arria 10.
   - Heterogeneous Computing: Use multiple processors for a single task - This
   is why OpenVINO is fast.
8. Developer Kits: 1. Up Squared* AI Vision Development Kit(rapid prototyping), 2. IEI Tank* AIOT
Developer Kit(demanding applications in an industrial environment)
